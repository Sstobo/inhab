# Instanews

This project is a webpage that pulls news stories from the New York Times API.

## Getting Started

This is my first submission for the Inhabitent site. I would estimate that it is 80% complete. I got stuck on several things, and will list them below.

## Learnings

As I became more confident navigating WP I really wanted to restart from the begining, as I used some hacky/ janky code to style the site in my early iterations. I decided that restarting a project every time I get better at coding is not a very effective way to develop. With this in mind, I noticed that each subsequent page became easier and more efficient. I am eager to apply my learnings to the next progect. 

## Challenges

Things I got stuck on:

Just as im about to submit I see I have broken my side bar on my journal page. 
I couldnt figure out how to differentiate between the single blog post and the single product page.
My search bar is a plug-in. I need to review my JS notes and complete my own version.
I didn't budget time for the adventure single posts. 
My header bar is universal for the whole site. I am working on applying links to the front page hero image.
I need to learn more about the Google Maps plugin. Locating the store was challenging.

## Reflections

Next project I work on I will:
Get a more complete idea of the scope, and budget time on a weekly basis for all the components.
Map out the taxonomy on paper so I am not searching every time I start styling a new page.
Use more Sass functionality to streamline my workflow (mixins, more complex variables, more specific scss files)
Focus on the granular details early in my project (I tend to prefer working on big picture stuff).
